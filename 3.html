    <p>he samosa is prepared with an all-purpose flour (locally known
       as maida) and stuffed with a filling, often a mixture of diced 
       and cooked or mashed boiled potatoes, onions, green peas, lentils,
       ginger, spices and green chillies.[19][20] A samosa can be either
       vegetarian or non-vegetarian, depending on the filling. The entire
       pastry is deep-fried in vegetable oil or (rarely) ghee until it
       achieves a golden-brown colour. It is served hot, often with fresh
       green chutneys, such as mint or coriander chutney, or tamarind chutney. </p>
