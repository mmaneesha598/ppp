    <p>Noodles are a type of food typically made from unleavened dough which 
       is rolled flat and cut, stretched, or extruded into long strips or strings.
       Noodles are a staple food in many cultures and made into a variety of shapes.
       The most common noodles are those derived from either Chinese cuisine or Italian 
       cuisine. Italian noodles are known as pasta, while Chinese noodles are known by 
       a variety of different names as there is no single unifying concept or terminology
       for "noodles" within Chinese culture. Additionally, many Chinese foods labeled as
      "noodles" in the English language are not made from dough but are called "noodles"
       because they serve a similar culinary role to dough-based noodles.</p>
