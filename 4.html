    <p>This is a list of Indian sweets and desserts, also called mithai,
       a significant element in Indian cuisine. Indians are known for 
       their unique taste and experimental behavior when it comes to 
       food. Many Indian desserts are fried foods made with sugar, milk 
       or condensed milk. Ingredients and preferred types of dessert vary
       by region. In the eastern part of India, for example, most are
       based on milk products. Many are flavoured with almonds and pistachios, 
       spiced with cardamon, nutmeg, cloves and black pepper, and decorated with
       nuts, or with gold or silver leaf.</p>
